# Basketball Scoreboard

## Description 

For this mini project, I followed a figma design given by Scrimba as means to create a basketball scoreboard (to see the template, [see here](https://www.figma.com/file/YC48MCx4frBFtYoz6rNJE6/Basketball-Scoreboard?node-id=0%3A1)). It is important to point out that I only followed the design template loosely as I wanted to put my own twist to it. The technologies used were HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
